# CNN-Transfer-Learning
- **E-commerce has changed the business world and the way we purchase items. A common problem faced by ecommerce owners/platforms is to appropriately tag images of products with labels, so product can be shown relevant to the buyer's search engine queries.**

## Project Goals: 
1. Create a classifier that can identify the label of a fashion product image using CNN 

2. Attempt to improve model. In my case, I implemented transfer learning using
the base model. In my project, I attempted to apply transfer learning using VGG16.
